# TroutScout

This project is abandoned

Initial idea was to track and store offline whenever the state of washington stocked lakes with trout. 
This is done by using JSOUP to scrape the washington department of fish and wildlife website and parse data into java objects.

Functionally this project was working well at time of abandonment. I was in the phase of refining the UI to be more user friendly.
